# Newly made website for film showcases

## OVERVIEW

This website is designed to showcase films by fetching data from an API. Users can view film posters and click on the images or the "Details" button to get more information about each film. The layout is dynamic, as it adjusts to different screen sizes, displaying 6 films on monitors, 4 on tablets, and 2 on phones. The website is built using JavaScript and Bootstrap.
